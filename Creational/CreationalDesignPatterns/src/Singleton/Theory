Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
while providing a global access point to this instance.

Questions - 

1 - What if there are multiple threads using getInstance at the same time ? Will it break the single ton pattern ?
2 - What are its uses in a real world project ? ( you have a one logger file , one cache , one printer )
3 - How can I destroy this object in case i want to ?
